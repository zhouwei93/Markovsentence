# welcome to markovsentence project!

Some algorithms and introductions about my code.

1. create a .txt document to save the origin content of sentence. 

2. define and use cin to input two prefix, this is the Markov Sentence prefix.

3. use two prefixs to search the content in the .txt, then if find out the word marked with these two prefixs(follow to these two words),
 this word will define as postfix. If marked with several words, use the random one as postfix.

4. the sentence move, save the prefix 2 to the position of prefix 1, abandon the previous prefix 1, then save the postfix to the position of prefix 2.

5.  the sentence move away, until encounter a dot. The whole sentence has created.

# How to use it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 compile with 'g++ -o sweep minesweeper.cpp' and then './sweep'

To get you started with C/C++,use the following sentence to complier:

Have a look at the files, and use the terminal to build them:

    g++ -o sweep minesweeper.cpp' and then './sweep
